# Project2-Foodies
This is my Project 2 from my Web Development Immersive bootcamp. Here I have built an application that allows customers to post their reviews/ratings for black owned restaurants. Users will be able to also see a feed of others visiting restaurants that they follow. The app also allows users to meet up with other foodies that want to try a black owned restaurant in their city.
